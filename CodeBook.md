## Describes the tidy data set create in Step 5 of the Course Project

The final data set contains Avg of each variable for each Subject and each Activity performed by 30 Volunteers using Samsung phones.The first column and second columns are Subject and Activity followed by Average of each variable that either contains mean or standard deviation.

Total Number of subjects 30 within an age bracket of 19-48 years

Total Number of Activities 6 ((WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

The variable names are abbreivated.

B - Body

A - Acceleration

G - Gravity

J - Jerk

g - gyro

M - Magnitude
